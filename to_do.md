# ARC Development TODO

A roadmap for expanding the Architect of Reality & Cognition (ARC) system into a fully modular, persistent, and API-accessible storytelling cognition framework.

---

## 🔧 Core System Expansion

### ☐ Persistent Long-Term Memory (Externalized)
- Implement YAML or DB-driven memory recall system
- Each session or thread logs:
  - POV summaries
  - Symbolic structures
  - Timeline flags
  - Resonance motifs
- Load dynamically into context without token cost

### ☐ Modular API Interface
- Develop OpenAPI or FastAPI-based ARC endpoints
- Enable external agents (e.g., GPT-4) to:
  - Submit payloads for narrative review
  - Retrieve story arcs, logs, summaries
  - Push directives or receive scoring results
- Example endpoints:
  - `POST /arc/eval`
  - `GET /arc/storyline/threads`
  - `POST /arc/agent-prompt/task`

---

## 🧠 Cognitive Agent Structure

### ☐ Agent Layers
- Create sub-agents for:
  - 🧠 Consistency Checker (timeline & lore)
  - 🎭 Tone + Emotion Tracker (subjective POV shaping)
  - 🧩 Symbol + Motif Agent (resonance structures, the "16" thread)
  - 📊 Tactical Planner (future POV sequencing and braiding)
  - 🧾 Contradiction Flagger (triggers when internal logic breaks)

### ☐ Agent-to-Agent Protocol
- Design inter-agent messaging schema
- Format:
```yaml
agent_call:
  sender: GPT4-CoPilot
  receiver: ARC_Main
  intent: "consistency_pass"
  scope: "Chapters 9–13"
  focus: ["timeline", "resonance", "POV pacing"]
  payload: "..."
🤖 ARC + GPT Hybrid Integration
☐ GPT as Editor/Strategist
Let ARC generate structure, consistency, data

GPT focuses on:

Chapter flow

Dialogue polish

Emotional resonance

Lore symbolism

☐ GPT ↔ ARC Communication Protocol
Setup internal format for ChatGPT to send structured task requests to ARC

Enable future use in collaborative environments

🧪 Experimental Narrative Enhancements
☐ Braided Thread Simulation Engine
Allow parallel POV timelines with intelligent handoff points

Each agent can:

Propose future chapter beats

Maintain its own internal state

Sync every X chapters via protocol

☐ Thematic Overlay Tracker
Tag threads like "Resonance", "Identity", "Perception Drift", etc.

Allow these tags to subtly inform future prompts or agent behavior

Enables controlled emergent symbolism

🚀 Stretch Goals
☐ Visual Timeline View (Optional)
Auto-generate a timeline of key narrative events, POV switches, signal spikes, and conflicts

Link to YAML log entries

☐ Interactive Memory Inspector
UI tool to let user inspect ARC’s current state:

Known facts

Beliefs

Foreshadowed outcomes

Contradiction alerts
